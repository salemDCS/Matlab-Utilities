3. Circular
4. Half-circle
* Click on the __Add Class__ button. A class with default properties will be created and can be seen in __Class plots__. __NOTE: The app now only supports 7 different classes.__
* The range of the plot can be modified in __Axes range__ section. This does not affect the generated classes, only changes the axes view
